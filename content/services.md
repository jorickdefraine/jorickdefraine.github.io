# DeFi Risk Assessment

*Understand your on-chain risk. Know what to monitor. Act with confidence.*

I help DeFi protocols, vault managers, and DAOs **clearly understand their on-chain risk exposure** using actionable data analysis and dashboards.

---

### The problem I solve

Most DeFi teams have data but **no clear view of risk**.

- Key parameters are not clearly identified
- Dashboards exist, but they don’t answer *risk* questions
- No shared framework to explain risk to partners, curators, or investors
- When markets move fast, decisions are made with partial information

**This creates uncertainty, slow reactions, and credibility issues.**

---

### The solution: a DeFi Risk Assessment

A **focused, one-off risk analysis** of your protocol or vault that gives you:

- a clear understanding of your main risk drivers
- concrete metrics to monitor
- a shared risk language your team can rely on

---

### What I do

I analyze your protocol or vault from a **risk and data perspective**, combining on-chain metrics with DeFi mechanics.

This typically includes:

- Analysis of **collateral & exposure**
- User behavior, inflows & outflows
- LTVs, liquidations, and stress points
- Identification of **critical risk parameters**
- Definition of **what should be monitored** and why

---

### What you get

- A **custom Dune dashboard**
    - usage & flows
    - key risk metrics
- A **concise written risk assessment**
    - main findings
    - risk drivers
    - actionable recommendations
- A **walkthrough call**
    - to align your team on the analysis

Everything is designed to be **clear, pragmatic, and usable**.

---

### Who this is for

This is a good fit if you are:

- running a DeFi protocol or vault
- managing risk for a DAO or strategy
- preparing discussions with partners or integrators
- lacking internal risk ownership but need clarity fast

---

### Format

- One-off engagement
- 1–2 weeks turnaround
- Fixed scope, no long-term commitment


---

### How it usually starts

1. Short intro call
2. You tell me what you want to understand or monitor
3. I deliver the Risk Assessment in 1-2 weeks.
4. You get clarity on your on-chain risk
