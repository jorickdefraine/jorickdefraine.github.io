# DeFi Risk & Data Analyst.

I help DeFi protocols, vault managers, and DAOs **understand and monitor their on-chain risk** using clear data analysis and dashboards.

I've been analyzing and building in decentralized finance since 2022, including managing **$20M+ in assets** as a Data & FinOps Engineer at **Morpho**.

I perform structured **on-chain risk assessments** and design **monitoring dashboards** that help teams identify key risk drivers, make better decisions, and communicate clearly with partners.

Building open-source yield optimizers, on-chain analytics dashboards, and DeFi risk monitoring systems.
