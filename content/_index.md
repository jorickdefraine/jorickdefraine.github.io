# DeFi Data Analyst.

I've been analyzing and building in decentralized finance since 2022, including managing $20M+ in assets as a Data & Operations Engineer at Morpho Labs.

Currently crafting data analytics tools and dashboards while deep-diving into DeFi protocols and smart contract mechanisms. Passionate about making financial infrastructure more transparent and accessible through data.

Building: Open-source yield optimizers, on-chain analytics dashboards, and DeFi risk monitoring systems.

When not analyzing protocols, you'll find me working out, traveling, or spending time with family.
